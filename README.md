# Auntie John's Programming Articles. 
## 1988 to 1991

Once upon a time there was a bloke - me - who liked to mess around with Z80 programming on the Amstrad CPC computers. Thanks to a certain Jeff Walker who created a fanzine called WACCI, this bloke got a gig writing articles for Amstrad Computer User magazine in the UK in about 1988, under the name “Auntie John” for various reasons. These are all the articles. Warning: they stray from programming into quite adolescent topics, and frankly, nothing has changed since then.
